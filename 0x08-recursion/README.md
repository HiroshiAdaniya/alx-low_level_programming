# Recursions

Recursions are functions that calls itself within itself. This helps solve complex problems and find solutions to mathematical problems.

Recursion has two forms; Direct recursion, and indirect recursion. These two types can be further defined and clarified by determined if they are tail recursions or non-tail recursions.

### Direct recursions

Direct recursions are functions that directly calls itself within itself.

### Indirect recursions

Indirect recursive functions are functions that calls other functions but will end with one of them calling the original function that had first call any of he other functions, creating a circular loop.

### Tail and non-tail

Tail recursions are functions that has no other statements to execute after the function has been called, While non-tail function still has one or more statements to execute after the function has been called.
